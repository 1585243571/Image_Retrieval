# Image_Retrieval
*Image Retrieval in Digital Libraries - Multicollection Experimentation of Machine Learning techniques*

### Synopsis
This work use an ETL (extract-transform-load) approach to help image retrieval in multicollection digital librairies. 
That aims to: 
1. Identify and extract iconography wherever it may be found, in image collections but also in printed materials (newspapers, magazines, books); 
2. Transform, harmonize and enrich the image descriptive metadata (in particular with machine learning classification tools)
3. Load it all into a web app dedicated to image retrieval.
